# CSharp

Welcome to my C# learning repository! This repo contains a series of small projects and exercises I completed while learning core concepts of C# and ASP.NET. These projects helped me understand key programming principles and gain practical experience with C# development.

## üí° What I Learned

### ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#

- **Classes and Objects**  
  I learned how to define classes, instantiate objects, and work with properties and methods in C#.

- **Methods with Parameters**  
  I created methods that take parameters, perform operations, and display results.

- **Operator Overloading**  
  I learned how to overload the `==` and `!=` operators to compare objects by specific properties (e.g., Employee `Id`), and how to properly override `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` for consistency.

- **Interfaces and Polymorphism**  
  I created a custom interface `IQuittable`, implemented it in an `Employee` class, and used polymorphism to call interface methods on class instances. This helped me understand how interfaces define contracts and enable flexible, loosely-coupled code.

## üñ• Console Applications

### 1. Math Operation Method  
A method that accepts two integers, performs a math operation on one, and prints the other. Demonstrated positional and named parameter calls.

### 2. Employee Class Comparison  
Created an `Employee` class and overloaded comparison operators to compare employees by their `Id`.

### 3. Interface Implementation  
Implemented the `IQuittable` interface in the `Employee` class and used polymorphism to call the `Quit()` method.

## üåê ASP.NET MVC Application

In addition to console applications, I also created a basic **ASP.NET MVC Application**. This introduced me to:

- MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller)
- Routing, controllers, views, and models
- How to build and run a simple web application with form input and data display

## üõ† Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Framework / .NET Core
- Visual Studio
- ASP.NET MVC
